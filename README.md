mean time before awake

## problem

I want to keep creating small applications to completion that improve my life.  
Every morning for me is a struggle to get motivated about the day, but I have a solution: yoga.  
However, every morning I forget this fact and spend a lot of time in my mopy state of mind.  
I made a goal to reduce the time between literal wakeup and emotional wakeup.  
This app tracks that progress.  

## technical roadmap

[ ] able to press a button to track the time of completion of yoga and meditation that records to a local database  
[ ] able to install on personal phone (pixel 6 pro)  
[ ] sync to web service upon change (push all data, it's small)  
[ ] read local system alarm clock to record the wakeup time for the day
